this is gnu-murd,the gnu-hurd revisited
why this name?
well, gnu-murd is actually a wordplay:
in fact its called murd because it is supposed to murder gnu hurd. but wee also choosed it because the "m" in the name stands for microkernel
gnu-murd is curently unusable even as docker image due to the bugs
